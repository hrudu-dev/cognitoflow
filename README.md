# CognitoFlow - Enterprise AI Policy Engine

A zero-code AI model policy engine for B2B applications with drag-and-drop interface for managing AI policies (data privacy, ethical use) integrated with AI SDLC and hybrid cloud migration compliance.

## 🎯 Project Vision
Enable non-technical users to create, manage, and enforce AI governance policies across hybrid cloud environments with enterprise-grade security, cost optimization, and sustainability.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Zero-Code Policy Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for AI policy creation
- **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**: AWS + On-premises integration
- **AI-Powered Compliance**: Bedrock LLM for policy validation
- **Cost-Effective Scaling**: Serverless-first with intelligent resource optimization
- **Sustainable Computing**: Green cloud practices and carbon footprint tracking
- **Enterprise Security**: Multi-layer authentication and zero-trust architecture

## 🏗️ Enhanced AWS Architecture
