# CognitoFlow - Enterprise AI Policy Engine

A zero-code AI model policy engine for B2B applications with drag-and-drop interface for managing AI policies (data privacy, ethical use) integrated with AI SDLC and hybrid cloud migration compliance.

## 🎯 Project Vision
Enable non-technical users to create, manage, and enforce AI governance policies across hybrid cloud environments with enterprise-grade security, cost optimization, and sustainability.

## 🚀 Three Key Features

### 1. Zero-Code AI Policy Engine with CognitoFlow Authentication
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Create policies without coding using pre-built templates
- **Real-Time Enforcement**: Lambda-based policy validation with <100ms latency
- **CognitoFlow Authentication**: Secure CUSTOM_AUTH flows with MFA and passwordless options
- **B2B Integration**: Seamless API integration with Salesforce, SAP, and other enterprise systems
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX compliance

### 2. AI SDLC Pipeline with Automated Compliance Checks
- **End-to-End MLOps**: From problem framing to production deployment
- **Policy-as-Code**: Automated compliance validation using OPA and YAML configurations
- **AWS Integration**: SageMaker, Bedrock, and OpenSearch for enterprise AI workflows
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time bias detection, drift monitoring, and performance tracking
- **Automated Retraining**: Trigger model updates based on compliance violations or performance degradation

### 3. Compliant Legacy System Modernization with CognitoFlow Security
- **Assessment Framework**: Comprehensive technical debt and compliance gap analysis
- **CloudFormation Templates**: Infrastructure-as-Code for AWS ECS deployment
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Passwordless authentication with WebAuthn and device compliance
- **Hybrid Integration**: Seamless on-premises to cloud migration with Direct Connect
- **Cost Optimization**: 30% infrastructure savings through serverless and intelligent scaling
